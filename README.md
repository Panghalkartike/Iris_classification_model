# Iris classification model
This project, "Iris Classification," demonstrates the creation of a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species using Python libraries such as TensorFlow, pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn. Leveraging the classic Iris dataset, the project involves loading and exploring the data to understand feature relationships and distributions. After preprocessing the data, a neural network model is constructed using TensorFlow, trained on the dataset, and evaluated for accuracy. The model's performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, with training and validation progress visualized to ensure effective learning. This project exemplifies the application of machine learning techniques to a well-known dataset, providing insights into the process of developing, training, and evaluating a classification model in Python.
